##Who

The main misunderstanding about CoachRetreat is that it's exclusive for coaches. We have to admit the name CoachRetreat is not helping.
So if it's not exclusive for coaches and scrummasters, who is it for?

In short anyone who want to practise having a coaching conversation. Yes that is basicially almost everyone.

I remember welcoming agile coaches, delivery managers, developers, educators, product owners, product managemers, project managers, scrummasters, testers, trainers and even some c-level people. 

And guess what? For some persons, whatever their job, it could be a real revelation... 

We think the maximum amount of peopel is around 20 to 25 people. yet as it's a free event on a saturday, this means people might drop out, it might be good to allow up to 30 people.
