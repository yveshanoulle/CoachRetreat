# Foreword {#Foreword}

In 2011 I organised the first CoachRetreat, on the request of Jurgen Desmet. 
After I wrote a blogpost about it, Oana Juncu contacted me. 

She loved the idea and she imagined a new format. Her proposal is the format we had use today. What we have done at the fist COachRetrat was something totally different, yet her idea was so much better. Hence CoachRetreat 2.0 was born. 

Oana & me, went on to co-organise the next CoachRetreat in Paris. The next 5 years, more than 30 CoachRetreats were organised in 12 different countries by 20 different facilitators. 

This manual was created to help people that want to have a local CoachRetreat. 

If anything is not clear, feel free to ask questions to one of the authors, facilitators personally or (preferable) on the CoachRetreat mailing list, where you can find all of us.

People think CoachRetreat is FREE. It's not. We ask you to invest the most expensive currency. Your time. Worse, your weekend time. 

I'm convinced it's a big reason of our succes. We get the most motivated individuals. 
Yes I'm well aware that some people can't make that investment for all kinf of personal reasons. We do miss nice individuals because of that. As we are still small, it's very important to have events where the majority of the participants go home with the idea this can't be improved. They think we are the reason. As much as my ego loves to hear that, I know their investment is a big part of why they feel this.
